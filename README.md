# Fourier-Transform-in-Finance
## Application of the **Fast Fourier Transform** (FFT) for detecting patterns in *financial time series*. 

There is a huge literature concerning the application of the FFT in finance, more specifically applied in financial time series in order to detect patterns or general characteristics.\
The aim of this project is just to give a very straightforward implementation of the algorithm to model some time series.

The main libraries used are:
* **yfinance:** for collecting financial data;
* **scipy:** for computing the FFT.
